          <P>In a fortuitous encounter, Jane's path unexpectedly intersected with that of a young man, David. 
            Little did they know that this seemingly insignificant moment would become the catalyst for an 
            extraordinary journey that would forever alter the course of their lives. 
            As time went on, Jane and David who were originally engaged in constant arguments and fights found 
            themselves drawn to one another in ways they couldn't comprehend. 
            However, David, burdened by the weight of his family's legacy, found himself entangled in a bitter 
            battle with his uncle over the control of his grandfather's company. The once harmonious family 
            dynamics had crumbled under the weight of greed and power struggles. 
            Despite David's best efforts to push Jane away for her protection, she remained by his side, 
            unflinching in her support and prepared to face the difficult challenges that lay ahead of them.

          <h3>RISE OF THE XENOS</h3>
          <img src="IMAGES/Rise.jpg" alt="Rise" width="400">
          <p>A special gem called Auragmite was very important to the Xenos, an alien race. It combined the bright aura of Aurorite and the fiery essence of Pyragem which held enormous power, giving them great power and helping them survive and grow. Somehow, this precious gem found it’s way to earth, resulting in a devastating impact that destroyed almost half of the planet. 
            The Xenos couldn't thrive without the Auragmite, so they had to retrieve it or stay close to where it was to keep their power and stay alive. However, retrieving the gem from Earth proved to be a challenge. Despite their search efforts, they could not find it, they could only sense its lingering presence, leaving them without a clear path to recovery.
            The King of the Xenos, Carlos, a malevolent and ruthless creature, decided to take over Earth's territory, believing that by possessing the planet, they would eventually find the indestructible gem they desperately sought and also it was the only way for the Xenos to remain alive. In the process, Carlos mercilessly exterminated any living being that crossed his path.
            Amidst the devastation caused by the Auragmite’s impact, a kid named Rex somehow survived because the gem was now inside him. On the other hand, King Carlos spared a little girl named May and helped her live, and she seemed to please him for some reason.
